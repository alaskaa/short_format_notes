## Using these notes

These notes use the jekyll static site generator. Although jekyll is the system used to compile and generate github pages sites, these notes won't work if you just push them to github as they rely on a custom build plugin. Instead you need to generate the html version of the site locally and then push it up to github.

If you are using them for your own course you should host your own copy of the notes. To do this, do the following:

1. Fork the code61 version of the notes.
2. Clone your forked repository down onto your machine (e.g. into a `code61_notes` folder)
3. Install the required dependencies:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

3. Create a new, separate deployment repository (e.g. `mycourse_site`) on github.
4. Clone your deployment repository down into a `_gh-pages` folder *inside* your `code61_notes` folder. (`_gh-pages` is ignored in the `.gitignore`, so this shouldn't cause problems.)

    git clone <mycourse_site_repo> _gh-pages

5. In your `code61_notes` folder, run `rake publish`. This will
    1. Generate your site into the `_site` folder.
    2. Copy this across to the `_gh-pages` folder.
    3. Force push the contents of the `_gh-pages` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your `mycourse_site` repo.

## Deploying to a custom url

Using a custom url should be straightforward - just add a CNAME at the root level of the project and deploy as normal. (The CNAME is gitignored on the main repo, but not in the _gh-pages sub-repo, so this should all be fine.)
