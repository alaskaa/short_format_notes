### Buy a domain name

Your domain name will be used to point towards your personal website for the course - it's up to you exactly what this will be about. You might want to use this opportunity to create a basic 'personal landing page' saying a bit about yourself and where to find more information. Or you might want to put up a blog. Alternatively if you want you can put up a page about something you are interested in (or [your dog](http://jamfly.info/)). You will need to pick a domain name accordingly!

To buy a domain name you need to visit a domain registrar. Examples are:

* [123-reg](http://www.123-reg.co.uk/)
* [Godaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/)
* [Namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com/)
* [dot.tk](http://www.dot.tk/en/index.html?lang=en) (.tk domains are completely free!)

There probably won't be a huge difference in price between these sites. You might be able to find a special offer on one of them if you shop around a bit though. Ultimately the domain you choose isn't that important for the course - the whole point is to practice pointing a domain name towards a server.

{% exercise %}
1. Buy your own domain name.
2. Follow [these instructions](https://www.bitballoon.com/docs/custom_domains/) to point your custom domain towards your code on BitBalloon.
