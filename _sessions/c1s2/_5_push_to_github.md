Git is a version control system. It allows you to keep the entire history of your code, and makes it easy to share and collaborate with others.

### Using git on a folder

Git works on a folder level: 

On your laptop, a git repository is just a **special type of folder**. Any folder can be made into a git repository (but not all folders should - e.g. don't make your entire documents directory into a git repository, you'll run into problems). You'll normally make a new git repository for each coding project you work on.

If you look inside the folder, you won't see all the different versions stored there (they are actually there - just stored inside a hidden folder called `.git`) - you'll only see the files that are in your **working copy**. Normally this working copy will contain the files from the last commit on the master branch, along with any changes you've made.
