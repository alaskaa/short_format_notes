* Webpage is just a collection of files: HTML, CSS & Javascript.
* We can edit these files locally.
* We can create them locally (using a text editor) and view then in a
browser.

### Command line

* `ls` - list the files in the current directory
* `cd coding_course` - move into the 'coding_course' directory
* `cd ..` - move up a level
