### HTML/CSS

* Webpage is just a collection of files: HTML, CSS & Javascript.
* We can edit these files locally.
* We can create them locally (using a text editor) and view then in a
browser.

### Putting your site online

We're going to use [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/) to host our site - BitBalloon will provide the server where the files for our site is stored.

{% exercise %}
1. Create an account on [BitBalloon](https://www.bitballoon.com/).
2. Upload your site by dragging and dropping your `first_site` folder onto the BitBalloon website.
3. Visit your site online!
{% endexercise %}

Your site will currently show up with a url something like [teller-balances-48402.bitballoon.com](teller-balances-48402.bitballoon.com). Part of your homework will be to buy your own domain name to point towards BitBalloon. (You will need to upgrade to the $5/month BitBalloon account to make this possible.)

### Preparation

{% exercise %}
1. Go to the github repository for this session: [https://github.com/code61/html2](https://github.com/code61/html2)
2. Download the code into your `coding_course` folder (by clicking 'Download ZIP' in the bottom right).
