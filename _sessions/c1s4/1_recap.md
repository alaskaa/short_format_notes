### CSS

We're now going to add a separate CSS file to your first_site. (If you
already have one, that's fine - just add another one.)

{% exercise %}
1. Create a new file in sublime text and save it as `main.css` in your
   first_site folder.
2. Put a CSS rule in that file (e.g. `h1 {color: red}`)
3. Put a link to the file from the head section of your index.html file.
4. Make sure you can see the style when you open index.html in chrome.
