### Preparation for next time

{% exercise %}
1. Complete the whole of Project 2 on the [General Assembly Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects) site. 
3. (Optional) Do the projects from the [Codecademy Web Track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web) Sections 4, 5 &amp; 6.

### Make a start on your own site

{% exercise %}
Use what you've learnt from the HTML exercise and the Dash projects to improve your `first_site/index.html`. Maybe add some content about yourself. Don't worry if it doesn't look great yet - we'll be working on it more in the next few weeks. Just make sure it says something more than 'Hello'!
